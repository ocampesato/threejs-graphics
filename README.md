# ThreeJS-based Graphics
These code samples work on Safari 8 and Firefox 8 on my Macbook Pro (Yosemite 10.10), but they do _not_ work in Chrome 41, despite the fact that I originally created the samples in the version of Chrome that was available at that time.

These samples are very CPU-intensive and no doubt they can be optimized to improve performance.

Please note that although I created the graphics effects (similar to code samples in some of my other repositories), the WebGL code is from a Web page that I found online about two years ago.  

I cannot find the original Web page (alas), and I don't remember the author, so I'm hoping that that person will stumble across these samples so that I can give him attribution.
